# About Rings in Zeolites
## Nomenclature
Rings are described by the number of tetrahedral (T-) sites they contain. The image below shows a ring containing 5 T-sites, and is denoted as a 5-membered ring (5-MR). The number of oxygen (O-) site and T-sites contained in a ring are equal. So our 5-MR also contains 5 O-sites.

## Valid Rings
Here we consider valid rings to be cycles through a zeolite framework for which no path exists that can decompose the cycle into smaller cycles. This rule is generally accepted, and was presented by Goetzke, K. and Klein, H.-J. [here](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/002230939190145V).

## Zeolite Ring Tools
All the rings presented here were found and analyzed using Zeolite Simulation Environment (ZSE), and open source Python package available [here](https://github.com/jtcrum/zse). 

Another software tool for finding zeolite rings is the Fortran code by Sastre, G. and Gale, J.: [zeoTsites](http://www.upv.es/~gsastre/zeotsites.html).

Some results were compared between the two software packages to ensure accuracy. 

## Zeolite Structures
All structures used for analysis were collected from the [Database of Zeolite Structures](http://www.iza-structure.org/databases/).

## Geometric Analysis
All geometric analysis was done using [Atomic Simulation Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html).
