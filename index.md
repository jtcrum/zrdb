# About Rings in Zeolites
## Nomenclature
Rings are described by the number of tetrahedral (T-) sites they contain. The image below shows a ring containing 5 T-sites, and is denoted as a 5-membered ring (5-MR). The number of oxygen (O-) site and T-sites contained in a ring are equal. So our 5-MR also contains 5 O-sites.

## Valid Rings
Here we consider valid rings to be cycles through a zeolite framework for which no path exists that can decompose the cycle into smaller cycles. This rule is generally accepted, and was presented by Goetzke, K. and Klein, H.-J. [here](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/002230939190145V).
